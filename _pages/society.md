It is an enormous privilege to being a researcher in academia. I believe researchers should also contribute to creating meaningful social impact beyond academia.
As a co-organizer of the [Kimball Smith Series](https://kimballsmithseries.yale.edu), I help foster important conversations at Yale University that engage both the academic community and the broader public on critical societal issues.

I am also passionate about public communication. You can follow my Chinese WeChat public account, *WeThoughts*, for more insights into my thoughts and experiences. I am also one of the finalists of the [Yale 3-Minitue Thesis Competition 2024](https://youtu.be/Wl1yjGmBOGg?si=6cXncnODqkZA77Z4&t=2048).
