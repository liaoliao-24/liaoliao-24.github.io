I am an undergraduate student of Class 2021 at the University of Notre Dame. I am double majoring in physics and philosophy. In physics, I
am interested in how a collection of particles interact with each other&mdash;the condensed matter systems. In philosophy,
I am interested in how a collection of people interact with each other&mdash;moral and political philosophy. I like reading and thinking. I also like photography, play bridge, traveling, and gaming.
