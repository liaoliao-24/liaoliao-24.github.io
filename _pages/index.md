title: Who Am I?
---

I am a Ph.D. student in theoretical neuroscience at Yale University, where I explore how neural systems give rise to complex behavior.

## Background

I earned my B.S. from the University of Notre Dame in 2021 with a double major in physics and philosophy. My academic interests span both fields: in physics, I'm drawn to understanding emergent behaviors in complex systems; in philosophy, I focus on moral and political philosophy, particularly how individuals and societies interact.

## What I Value

Beyond research, I'm passionate about reading, thinking, writing, and exploring different cultures through travel and the arts. *The Analects* and *War and Peace* are among my favorite works, and Confucius's philosophy deeply influences my worldview.

## Community Engagement

I believe in creating meaningful social impact beyond academia. I contribute to this goal as a co-organizer of the [Kimball Smith Series](https://kimballsmithseries.yale.edu), an initiative fostering important conversations at Yale.
