I am a Ph.D. student in theoretical condensed matter physics at
Yale.
I received my B.S. degree double major in physics and philosophy from the University of Notre Dame in year 2021. In physics, I
am interested in how a collection of particles interact with each other&mdash;the condensed matter systems. In philosophy,
I am interested in how a collection of people interact with each other&mdash;moral and political philosophy.
I like reading and thinking.
My favorite book is *The Analects*
and my favorite philosopher is accordingly Confucius. I also like play bridge, traveling, and gaming. You can follow my WeChat public account *WeThoughts* to know more about me.
