During my four years at Notre Dame, I have worked in multiple research groups spanning nuclear physics, applied math, and condensed matter physics. I have decided that I would pursue a Ph.D. degree in theoretical condensed matter physics in the future. You can read my [CV](/assets/LihaoYanCV.pdf) to learn more about my research.
